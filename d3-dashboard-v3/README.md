# F20DV Group Project Template

This starter project contains a basic web application template for your group project.

To do list:
 - [ ] One group member forks this project.
 - [ ] That same group member invites others to collaborate.
 - [ ] Each group member sets up their access to GitLab: SSH keygen; clone repo; configuration git user.email

Remember to keep this README file updated as you develop your interactive data visualisation dashboard.
